# Emberapp

This is a simple rails blog app, that serves as an API
for writing training EmberJS applications.

## Starting up

* Bundle with `bundle`
* Setup and seed db with `rake db:setup db:seed`
* Start rails server with `rails s`

## Users

There is one user seeded by default, with following credentials:

**Login:** `admin`

**Password:** `password`

## Development

If you are a vim user, clone your frontend app into `emberapp/` (it is git-ignored).
There are lot of useful vim projections available (see `.projections.json`).
