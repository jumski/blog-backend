# Emberapp

This is a backend application for [jumski/blog-frontend](https://github.com/jumski/blog-frontend).

## Starting up

* Bundle with `bundle`
* Setup and seed db with `rake db:setup db:seed`
* Start rails server with `rails s`

## Users

There is one user seeded by default, with following credentials:

**Login:** `admin`

**Password:** `password`

## Development

I prefer to clone frontend app into `emberapp/` (it is git-ignored). There are lot of useful vim projections available (see `.projections.json`).
